LAMMPS based particle filtration simulation. Project includes:
	LAMMPS input file generation (Python generated)
	Job submission (Python generated sbatch files)
	Data analysis (MATLAB calculated)

readlog.m and readdump_all.m as well as the LAMMPS software used to run the simulations are created by other Authors.

./Python includes all input generation and file manipulation scripts
./MATLAB includes all analysis scripts
