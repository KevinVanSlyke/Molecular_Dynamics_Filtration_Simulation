LAMMPS based particle filtration simulation. Project includes:
	Python scripts to generate input/sbatch files for LAMMPS software
	Python scripts to remove extra output files

<<<<<<< HEAD
readlog.m and readdump_all.m as well as the LAMMPS software used to run the simulations are created by other as indicated in file headers.
=======
	MATLAB scripts for data analysis of various LAMMPS outputs

readlog.m, readdump_all.m, readdump_one.m, scandump.m as well as the LAMMPS software used to run the simulations are created by other Authors.
